"""Cockpit-local 'mark_only' decisions on Caio Think Loop events.

Per plano canônico V1.1 (CRITICAL #4): the Cockpit *only* records that
Pedro has marked a Caio event as approved or rejected. It does **not**
execute any downstream action against Caio's pipelines, the OpenClaw gateway,
or the #wa-aprovacoes Discord channel. V2 will reintroduce an explicit
``mark_and_execute`` mode behind feature gating, after a proper idempotency +
audit + rollback path is in place.

The ``event_id`` we key on is the Caio event UUID written to
``~/.openclaw/state/events.sqlite`` (the same identifier the
``EventsSqliteReader`` surfaces in ``/api/v1/caio/think-loop/recent``).
